# TwtichPlaysSkyrim
A python script to parse twitch chat and play skyrim on the local machine. 

Currently, the game needs to be in focus while the script runs in the background. 

The chat commands are built around the idea that a user would want to do one of three things with a button: press, hold, and release. Therefore, command conventions are build around that with 'h' being the prefix for hold and 'r' being a prefix to release. And example would be 

| Command | What You Want To Do |
| --- | --- |
| he | Hold E |
| rlm | Release Left Mouse |

This formatting of commands might be confusing at first and feedback on how to improve them would be fantastic. I also want to add more verbose command names people could use instead, for example, if you want to hold the e button a user could type "he" or "Hold E".
